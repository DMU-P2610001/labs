  Beagles are great family pets but due to their strong hunting instincts they might not be the best dogs for homes with smaller pets. Beagles tend to be very tolerant and accepting by nature and so will fit into family life perfectly if well socialised from a young age.

Their size and affectionate personalities make Beagles a popular family pet but they can be quite high energy so always supervise your Beagle with children. Like any dog, they can be destructive when bored so make sure to keep their mind active with training and lots of exercise.
