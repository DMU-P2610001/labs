<p class="biop">Hello Fresh is a meal plan subscription that offers fresh ingredients with recipes delivered straight to your door. I bagged a £20 discount so thought I’d take you along with my Hello Fresh journey. Follow along with
  how I got on with our order & if you like the looks of it you can also have £20 off!

<p class="capure">How It Looks Inside</p>

<p class="biop">
We chose 3 meals worth of ingredients that came via courier (DPD) in the morning. Inside the box there were numbered bags that were linked to individual recipe cards. There was also an insulated plastic bag that contained all fridge items (meat, cheese etc) & ice blocks that kept the food cold. Everything that
needed extra packaging was vat packed but all packaging is 100% recyclable!

<p class="capure">All Of What We Need For This Dish</p>


<p class="biop">
  Having checked off all the ingredients with the recipes we decided to go with the
  ‘Crispy Chicken & Bombay Style Potatoes with Garlicky Green Beans & Raita’.

<p class="capure">The Steps</p>

<p class="biop">
  The recipes are step by step & easy to follow, this makes this subscription great for people of any cooking ability! They also contain all nutrition & allergy information, which is also available prior to choosing a meal on the Hello Fresh app/website should you have any allergies. Preparation time was very minimal, which is
  great if you’re in a rush or had a long day & want something quick & easy when home.

<p class="capure">Lets Get Cooking</p>


<p class="biop">
  I loved the flavours that this dish offered. Garlic is a favourite of mine & this had lots of it, alongside the mango chutney it worked really well. Served with a wedge of lime that cut through & helped liven up all of the vegetables. Topped with coriander making it
  fragrant & added that little extra! I shall defiantly be having this one again!

<p class="capure">Looking Good</p>


<p class="biop">
  Overall, I think this is a brilliant idea especially if you are new to cooking. It helps you grasp the idea of portions which will cut
  down on wastage & it gives useful tips you can use in everyday cooking.
