<!--i have wrote about my actual life, keeping it simple & easy -->
     <p>Tom is a 35-year-old man who lives with his partner Charlotte
       & their 2-year-old daughter, Violet. After losing his job a week before Christmas,
       Tom struggled to find work & was becoming lost in the world of ever-growing unemployment
       within the UK. Not only wanting a job for himself, he wanted to make sure his family,
       particularly his young daughter, had security as she grew older. Tom applied for further education at his local university doing something that he loves to do in his spare time, producing media.
    Follow Tom & his family as they head off into the next chapter of their lives, what obstacles will come their way? Will Tom graduate before Violet starts education of her own? Find out for yourselves on December 21st 2020!
